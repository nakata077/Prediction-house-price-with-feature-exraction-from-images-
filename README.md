# Prediction-house-price-with-feature-exraction-from-images

This project aims to develop a stacking ensemble model for predicting the prices of second-hand houses in Thailand

Methods:

(1) Data Cleaning: I perform data cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

(2) Data Enhancement: I enrich the dataset by extracting additional features from Google, such as the number of roads, highways, convenience stores, and public transportation options.

(3) Image-based Feature Extraction: I extract relevant features from house images, which are then incorporated as new features.

(4) XGBoost Modeling with Hyperparameter Tuning: I utilize the enhanced dataset, including the new features, to train an XGBoost model. Hyperparameter tuning is applied to optimize the model's performance.

It is evident that the error (MAPE) is significantly reduced compared to the individual model. The further enhancement of this project is published in
